# Need to create a basic calculator. 

1. Create () input fields that only contain numbers: 
- Input Field(1): Ask user to enter number1
- Input Field(2): Ask user to enter number2

2. Create a button which will ask user to enter the operator (+,-,*,/).

3. And Create a calculate button, when it's clicked you need to display the total result. 

- E.g. -> 
Number1= 5 
Number2= 10
Operator = + 
Output= 15
